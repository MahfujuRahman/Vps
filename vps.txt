For vps server setup in linux 

I am using wine to install MobaXtrem in ubuntu system.

1. Update your package list:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wine64 wine32

2. Verify the Wine version:
wine --version

3. Navigate to the directory where the MobaXterm .exe file is located.
Run it using Wine:
wine 'filepath'/MobaXterm_Portable_vXX.exe

example for my case : wine /home/ajmain/Downloads/MobaXterm_Portable_v24.3/MobaXterm_Personal_24.3.exe

No, you don’t need to run the command every time manually. You can create a **desktop shortcut** or a **custom launcher** to make running MobaXterm easier.

Here’s how you can set it up:

---

### 1. **Locate the MobaXterm File**
Make sure you know the full path to the `MobaXterm_Portable_vXX.exe` file. For example, let's say the file is in:
```
/home/ajmain/Downloads/MobaXterm_Portable_v23.2.exe
```

---

### 2. **Create a Desktop Shortcut**
1. Open a terminal and create a `.desktop` file in your desktop folder:
   ```bash
   nano ~/Desktop/MobaXterm.desktop
   ```

2. Add the following content to the file:
   ```ini
   [Desktop Entry]
   Name=MobaXterm
   Comment=Run MobaXterm using Wine
   Exec=wine /home/ajmain/Downloads/MobaXterm_Portable_v24.3/MobaXterm_Personal_24.3.exe
   Type=Application
   Icon=utilities-terminal
   Terminal=false
   Categories=Utility;
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/MobaXterm_Portable_vXX.exe` with the full path to your MobaXterm file.

3. Save and exit the editor (`Ctrl+O`, then `Enter`, and `Ctrl+X`).

4. Make the shortcut executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/Desktop/MobaXterm.desktop
   ```

---

### 3. **Add to Application Menu**
If you prefer it to appear in your application menu:
1. Move the `.desktop` file to `/usr/share/applications/`:
   ```bash
   sudo mv ~/Desktop/MobaXterm.desktop /usr/share/applications/
   ```

2. You can now search for "MobaXterm" in your application menu and run it like any other app.

---

### 4. **Automate Wine Configuration**
If MobaXterm requires specific Wine configurations, you can ensure these are applied automatically:
- Use `winetricks` to install dependencies globally.
- Add any required Wine prefix setup commands in a shell script and point the shortcut to it.

---

Now, you can launch MobaXterm easily without typing the command manually every time. Let me know if you face any issues!
